# Pong-game-modified

This is a throwback to the classic Pong game. I havew gathered a basic Pong game, and used Turtle and tkinter to have some fun building this retro game in Python. 

The Goal is to modify it slightly to gain better understanding on how to work through Python. The objectives include addin gcolors, adding a functional GUI that takes you to the game, addig chanign of ball speeds, and hopefully some new power ups.
